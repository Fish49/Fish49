# Project Ideas
- block coding that compiles to .exe files (with c++)
- desmos-like calculator, huge project with many features
- procudural game (like minecraft, but way more procudural, cubic chunks, tiny voxels, sparse octree optimization, etc.
- music creation program (I want it to heavily use splines, functions, and programming to be very customizable) *
- program to convert music into minecraft note blocks *
- vector graphics editor (using points instead of handles, constrainable geometry like in cad (tangent, midpoint, etc)) *
- skud pai sho bot *
- portfolio website *
- new web protocol, FishWeb, that fixes some of the current problems with web dev (JS for example) *
- operating system (maybe based on linux, maybe from scratch) that fixes some of the problems with current OS's such as inflexible file management, difficulty managing/installing programs
- 2048 bot*
- faster SAT solver
- python library for solving Apollonius problems (creating shapes tangent to multiple existing shapes)
- brainfuck IDE with many features (already made a python library that can initialize brainfuck state with few characters)
- Minecraft computer, fast, full color, internet and port capabilities, von neumann architecture

*repo already exists, but hasent seen activity in a while (little progress on the project)

# Completed (or viable and long dormant)
- python ray tracing rendering engine (simple, no anti-aliasing, no bounce reflections, only one light source)
- minesweeper solving bot
- python library for converting between rationals and integers (rationals and integers have the same cardinality, so a 1 to 1 mapping between rationals and integers is possible)
- better heap data structure library for python, including the option to make you heap a max heap, the option to pop from anywhere in the heap, and the option to use a sorting key
- Sabacc website
- Word Trip solver (using webcam, stylus, and 3d printer to interact with my phone)

# Active
- Steno game (like beatsaber but for stenography practice)
- Air hockey robot project (robot to play air hockey against you)

# Contributions to open-source projects
- svg-to-desmos library by harry7557558
