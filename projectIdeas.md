# Project Ideas
- block coding that compiles to .exe files (with c++)
- desmos-like calculator, huge project with many features
- procudural game (like minecraft, but way more procudural, cubic chunks, tiny voxels, sparse octree optimization, etc.
- music creation program (I want it to heavily use splines, functions, and programming to be very customizable) *
- program to convert music into minecraft note blocks *
- vector graphics editor (using points instead of handles, constrainable geometry like in cad (tangent, midpoint, etc)) *
- skud pai sho bot *
- portfolio website *
- new web protocol, FishWeb, that fixes some of the current problems with web dev (JS for example) *
- operating system (maybe based on linux, maybe from scratch) that fixes some of the problems with current OS's such as inflexible file management, difficulty managing/installing programs

*repo already exists, but hasent seen activity in a while (little progress on the project)
